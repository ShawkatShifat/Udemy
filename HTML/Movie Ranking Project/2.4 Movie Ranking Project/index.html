 <h1>The Best Movies To Watch</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>The Silent Voice</h3>
 <p>A movie worth watching time and time again. This Japanese animated film is considered to be one of the many masterpices in the animated film. A <em>MUST</em> watch</p>
 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
 <p>Perfect movie for those that are intrigued by the astonishments of the world beyond Earth. Uses science of space and time to stimulate the brain while keeping it interesting and full of suspense</p>
 <h3>Kingdom of Heavens</h3>
 <p>A respectable and non-biased representation of a great battle in Jerusalem that took place between the two great armies of that time.</p>
